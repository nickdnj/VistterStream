# ðŸŽ¯ Live Playback Position Tracking

## âœ… Feature Implemented

You now have a **live moving playhead** that follows the preview playback in real-time!

---

## ðŸŽ¬ What It Does

### Backend Tracking
- **Timeline Executor** now tracks current playback position
- Records: current cue, time position, loop count
- Updates every time a new cue starts

### API Endpoint
- **GET `/api/preview/playback-position`**
- Returns current playback state and position
- Polled every 500ms by frontend

### Visual Feedback
When preview is running, you'll see:

1. **ðŸ”´ LIVE indicator** on the playhead label
2. **Pulsing red playhead** that moves through the timeline
3. **Thicker, glowing line** (1px instead of 0.5px)
4. **Loop counter** showing which loop iteration (e.g., "Loop 2")
5. **Automatic playhead movement** following the current cue

---

## ðŸ“º How It Looks

### Before (Manual Playhead):
```
Normal red line, static position
```

### During Preview (Live Playhead):
```
ðŸ”´ LIVE â€¢ 0:23.5 â€¢ Loop 1
     â†‘
  Pulsing red line (animated)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
