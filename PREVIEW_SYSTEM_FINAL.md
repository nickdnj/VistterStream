# 🎉 Preview System - COMPLETE & READY!

## ✅ Final Fixes Applied

### 1. **Browser Cache Busting**
- Added timestamp parameter to HLS URL: `?t=${Date.now()}`
- Prevents browser from caching 404 responses
- Forces fresh manifest load every time

### 2. **Startup Delay**
- Waits 2 seconds after "Start Preview" before loading HLS
- Gives FFmpeg time to start publishing to MediaMTX
- Prevents premature 404 errors

### 3. **Loading State**
- Shows spinner: "Starting stream... Please wait 3-5 seconds"
- User-friendly feedback during stream startup
- Disappears when video starts playing

### 4. **UI Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed old "▶️ Preview" / "⏹️" buttons (didn't stream)
- ✅ Removed "Show Program Monitor" (static snapshots)
- ✅ Clean timeline with live playhead only

## 🔧 Technical Flow

### Preview Startup Sequence:
```
1. User clicks "Start Preview"
2. API: POST /api/preview/start {timeline_id: 1}
3. Backend starts Timeline Executor
4. Timeline Executor moves camera to preset (if specified)
5. FFmpeg starts with RTSP input + overlays
6. FFmpeg publishes to rtmp://localhost:1936/preview
7. MediaMTX receives RTMP stream (2-3s)
8. MediaMTX generates HLS manifest
9. Frontend waits 2 seconds
10. Frontend loads HLS with cache-busting
11. HLS.js retries up to 10 times if needed
12. Video appears! ✅
```

### Playback Position Updates:
```
1. Timeline Executor updates position on each cue
2. Frontend polls /api/preview/playback-position every 500ms
3. Updates playhead time automatically
4. Shows LIVE indicator and loop count
5. Playhead jumps to each cue smoothly
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If video stays black:
1. Check console for errors (F12)
2. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health`
3. Check preview status: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/preview/status`
4. Check HLS manifest: `curl http://localhost:8888/preview/index.m3u8`

### If playhead doesn't move:
1. Check playback position API: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/preview/playback-position`
2. Verify timeline has cues (not empty like "test4")
3. Check backend logs: `tail -50 /tmp/vistter-backend.log`

### If 404 errors persist:
1. Hard refresh browser (`Cmd+Shift+R`)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try in incognito/private window
4. Verify MediaMTX: `docker logs vistterstream-preview --since=10s`
