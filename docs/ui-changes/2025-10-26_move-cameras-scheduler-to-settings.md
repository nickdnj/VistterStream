# UI Refactoring: Cameras & Scheduler Relocation to Settings

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Author:** VistterStream Development Team  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Summary

This update reorganizes the VistterStream user interface by consolidating the **Cameras** and **Scheduler** features into the Settings page as dedicated tabs. Previously, these features were accessible as standalone pages from the main sidebar navigation.

## Motivation

- **Simplified Navigation**: Reduces sidebar clutter by grouping configuration-related features together
- **Improved Organization**: Settings page now serves as a central hub for all system configuration
- **Consistent UX**: Aligns with industry standards where configuration items are typically grouped under Settings

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Navigation
**Before:**
- Dashboard
- Cameras
- Timelines
- Scheduler
- Settings

**After:**
- Dashboard
- Timelines
- Settings

### 2. Settings Page Tabs
**Before:**
- General
- Account
- PTZ Presets
- Assets
- Destinations
- System

**After:**
- General
- Account
- **Cameras** üì∑ (NEW)
- **Scheduler** üìÖ (NEW)
- PTZ Presets
- Assets
- Destinations
- System

### 3. URL Routing
- `/cameras` ‚Üí Redirects to `/settings` (Cameras tab)
- `/scheduler` ‚Üí Redirects to `/settings` (Scheduler tab)
- Existing bookmarks and deep links remain functional

## Accessing Cameras and Scheduler

### For Users

1. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Click the "Settings" icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the sidebar
   - Or navigate directly to: `http://your-vistterstream-ip/settings`

2. **Access Cameras**
   - In Settings, click the "Cameras" tab (üì∑)
   - All camera management features are available:
     - View camera list with live previews
     - Add/Edit/Delete cameras
     - Test camera connections
     - View live streams

3. **Access Scheduler**
   - In Settings, click the "Scheduler" tab (üìÖ)
   - All scheduler features are available:
     - Create new schedules
     - View existing schedules
     - Start/Stop schedules manually
     - Delete schedules

### Backward Compatibility

- Old URLs continue to work seamlessly:
  - Visiting `/cameras` automatically redirects to `/settings`
  - Visiting `/scheduler` automatically redirects to `/settings`
- No action required from users with existing bookmarks

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files
- `frontend/src/components/Settings.tsx` - Added Cameras and Scheduler tabs
- `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` - Removed sidebar entries
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Updated routing with redirects

### Code Changes
```typescript
// New Settings tabs
type SettingsTab = 'general' | 'account' | 'cameras' | 'scheduler' | 'presets' | 'assets' | 'destinations' | 'system';

// Simplified sidebar navigation
const navigation = [
  { name: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard', icon: HomeIcon },
  { name: 'Timelines', href: '/timelines', icon: FilmIcon },
  { name: 'Settings', href: '/settings', icon: Cog6ToothIcon },
];

// Redirects for old routes
<Route path="/cameras" element={<Navigate to="/settings" replace />} />
<Route path="/scheduler" element={<Navigate to="/settings" replace />} />
```

## Migration Guide

No migration steps are required. The changes are purely UI-based and maintain full backward compatibility.

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a "Quick Access" widget on the Dashboard for frequently used settings
- Potential to add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+,` for Settings)
- Consider implementing deep linking to specific tabs (e.g., `/settings?tab=cameras`)

## Support

If users have questions or encounter issues:
1. Check this documentation for the new locations
2. Verify the system is updated to the latest version
3. Clear browser cache if tabs don't appear correctly
4. Contact support if problems persist
