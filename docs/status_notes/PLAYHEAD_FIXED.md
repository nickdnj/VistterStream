# ✅ Playhead NOW ADVANCING IN REAL-TIME!

## The Problem
Position only updated at the **start** of each cue, then stayed frozen for the entire cue duration (e.g., stuck at 0.0 for 41 seconds).

## The Solution
Added **continuous position tracking** that updates every 500ms during cue execution.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Backend (`timeline_executor.py`):

**Before:**
```python
# Position updated once at cue start
self.playback_positions[timeline_id] = {
    "current_time": cue.start_time,  # Fixed at 0.0, 41.0, etc
    ...
}
```

**After:**
```python
# Background task updates position every 500ms
async def _update_position_during_cue(...):
    while True:
        elapsed = (now - start).total_seconds()
        current_time = cue.start_time + min(elapsed, duration)
        self.playback_positions[timeline_id] = {
            "current_time": current_time,  # Continuously advancing!
            ...
        }
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
```

## ✅ Verified Working

### Test Results:
```
At 2s: current_time = 1.5s ✅
At 5s: current_time = 4.5s ✅
Advancing: ~1.0s per second ✅
```

### System Status:
```
✅ Backend running with continuous tracking
✅ FFmpeg publishing to MediaMTX
✅ HLS manifest available
✅ Position API updating every 500ms
✅ Frontend polling every 500ms
```
