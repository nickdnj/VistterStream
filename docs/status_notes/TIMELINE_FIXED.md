# ✅ Timeline Fixed - 3 Cameras Working!

## The Problem

**Database had 24 DUPLICATE cues:**
- 8x Cue 0 (0s-41s, Camera 7)
- 8x Cue 1 (41s-81.5s, Camera 6)
- 8x Cue 2 (81.5s-122s, Camera 7)

This caused:
- Timeline stuck on first camera
- Playhead resetting instead of advancing
- Confusion with cue progression

---

## The Solution

**Rebuilt timeline with 3 clean cues:**
1. **Cue 0**: 0s-41s → Camera 7 (Sunba PTZ) - Zoomed In
2. **Cue 1**: 41s-81.5s → Camera 6 (Reolink Wharfside)
3. **Cue 2**: 81.5s-122s → Camera 7 (Sunba PTZ) - Zoomed Out

## ✅ Verified Working

###Timeline Progression:
```
Loop 1:
  0s-41s: Cue 1 (Sunba PTZ Zoomed In) ✅
  41s-81.5s: Cue 2 (Reolink Wharfside) ✅
  81.5s-122s: Cue 3 (Sunba PTZ Zoomed Out) ✅

Loop 2:
  0s-41s: Cue 1 (back to start) ✅
  ... continues looping ...
```

### Backend Status:
```
✅ Position tracking: Working (updates every 500ms)
✅ Cue progression: Working (advances through all 3)
✅ Loop detection: Working (Loop 2 confirmed)
✅ FFmpeg: Publishing to MediaMTX
✅ HLS: Manifest available
```

## 🎬 What to Expect in Browser

After refresh, you'll see:

### **First 41 seconds** (Cue 1):
- Video: Sunba PTZ camera (zoomed in)
- Playhead: 0s → 41s
- Status: `🔴 LIVE • 0:XX.X`

### **41s to 81.5s** (Cue 2):
- **Camera switches** to Reolink Wharfside
- Playhead: 41s → 81.5s
- Video may have brief black during switch

### **81.5s to 122s** (Cue 3):
- **Camera switches** back to Sunba PTZ (zoomed out)
- Playhead: 81.5s → 122s

### **After 122s** (Loop):
- Timeline loops back to start
- Shows: `Loop 2` badge
- Continues: Cue 1 → Cue 2 → Cue 3 → Loop 3 → ...

## ⚠️ Note About Camera Switches

When timeline switches cameras (at 41s and 81.5s):
- FFmpeg stops and restarts
- Brief black screen (1-2 seconds)
- HLS may show 404 during transition
- **This is normal** - will be fixed with seamless executor later
