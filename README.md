# VistterStream

A local streaming appliance that connects on-premises cameras to VistterStudio cloud timelines. VistterStream discovers, manages, and processes local cameras, including PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) presets, and streams the final output to destinations such as YouTube Live, Facebook Live, or Twitch.

## Overview

VistterStream is designed to run on hardware like the Raspberry Pi in a Docker container, providing a web interface for camera management and live streaming capabilities. It ingests RTSP/RTMP feeds, applies overlays and instructions received from VistterStudio, and streams the final output to various platforms.

## Key Features

- **Camera Management**: Support for RTSP/RTMP cameras including Reolink (stationary) and Amcrest/Samba (PTZ)
- **PTZ Presets**: Define and execute preset positions for PTZ cameras
- **Live Previews**: Embedded video preview for each camera feed
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time camera connection status and system metrics
- **Web Interface**: Local-only web UI for configuration and monitoring
- **FFmpeg Processing**: Professional video processing with overlays and transcoding
- **Multi-Output Streaming**: Support for multiple streaming destinations simultaneously

## Target Users

- **Small businesses & venues**: Shops, restaurants, marinas, and tourist attractions
- **Community organizations**: Visitor bureaus or chambers of commerce
- **Property managers & real estate**: Broadcasting properties or scenic angles
- **Event operators**: Local operators who need reliable camera-to-stream appliances

## Architecture

- **Single-container modular architecture** with Docker
- **Web UI**: React frontend with Tailwind CSS
- **API Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for REST APIs
- **Controller**: Manages camera configs, PTZ, and state
- **Stream Engine**: FFmpeg wrapper for video processing
- **Database**: SQLite for persistent local storage

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Streaming**: FFmpeg (multi-arch build)
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-arch support (x86_64 & ARM64)
- **Authentication**: Local username/password with bcrypt

## Test Cameras

The project includes configuration for local test cameras:

### Reolink (Fixed position camera)
- **Main Stream**: `rtsp://Wharfside:Wharfside2025!!@192.168.86.250:554/Preview_01_main`
- **Snapshot**: `http://Wharfside:Wharfside2025!!@192.168.86.250:80/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=onvifSnapPic&channel=0`

### Sunba (PTZ camera with ONVIF support)
- **Main Stream**: `rtsp://192.168.86.23:554/user=admin_password=sOKDKxsV_channel=0_stream=0&onvif=0.sdp?real_stream`
- **Snapshot**: `http://192.168.86.23/webcapture.jpg?command=snap&channel=0&user=admin&password=sOKDKxsV`

## Development Status

**Milestone 1 COMPLETED** ‚úÖ - Foundation & Local Camera Integration

### What's Working:
- **üöÄ FastAPI Backend**: Complete REST API with authentication, camera management, and database models
- **üé® React Frontend**: Beautiful dark-themed UI with Tailwind CSS, responsive design
- **üì∑ Camera Integration**: Full support for Reolink and Sunba cameras with RTSP testing
- **‚ö° Real-time Monitoring**: Live camera status, system metrics, and health monitoring
- **üíæ Database**: SQLite with complete schema for cameras, presets, streams, and users
- **üîê Authentication**: Secure login system (minor frontend flow issue pending)

### Screenshots:
- Beautiful login interface with dark theme
- Professional dashboard with system metrics
- Camera management with real-time status
- Responsive design that works on all devices

### Current Features:

- PTZ preset management (ready)
- User authentication system

### Technical Architecture:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM, Pydantic schemas, JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema for cameras, users, presets, streams
- **Camera Support**: OpenCV for RTSP testing, HTTP requests for snapshots
- **Real-time Features**: Live status monitoring, health checks, system metrics
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling and validation
- **Security**: Bcrypt password hashing, JWT tokens, CORS configuration
- **UI/UX**: Professional dark theme, responsive design, beautiful animations

## Next Steps - Milestone 2: Local Streaming Pipeline

1. Implement FFmpeg integration for video processing
2. Add YouTube Live streaming capabilities
3. Create stream management interface
4. Implement overlay system for VistterStudio integration
5. Add stream recording and monitoring
