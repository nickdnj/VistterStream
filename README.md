# VistterStream

A local streaming appliance that connects on-premises cameras to VistterStudio cloud timelines. VistterStream discovers, manages, and processes local cameras, including PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) presets, and streams the final output to destinations such as YouTube Live, Facebook Live, or Twitch.

## Overview

VistterStream is designed to run on hardware like the Raspberry Pi in a Docker container, providing a web interface for camera management and live streaming capabilities. It ingests RTSP/RTMP feeds, applies overlays and instructions received from VistterStudio, and streams the final output to various platforms.

## Key Features

- **Camera Management**: Support for RTSP/RTMP cameras including Reolink (stationary) and Amcrest/Samba (PTZ)
- **PTZ Presets**: Define and execute preset positions for PTZ cameras
- **Live Previews**: Embedded video preview for each camera feed
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time camera connection status and system metrics
- **Web Interface**: Local-only web UI for configuration and monitoring
- **FFmpeg Processing**: Professional video processing with overlays and transcoding
- **Multi-Output Streaming**: Support for multiple streaming destinations simultaneously

## Target Users

- **Small businesses & venues**: Shops, restaurants, marinas, and tourist attractions
- **Community organizations**: Visitor bureaus or chambers of commerce
- **Property managers & real estate**: Broadcasting properties or scenic angles
- **Event operators**: Local operators who need reliable camera-to-stream appliances

## Architecture

- **Single-container modular architecture** with Docker
- **Web UI**: React frontend with Tailwind CSS
- **API Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for REST APIs
- **Controller**: Manages camera configs, PTZ, and state
- **Stream Engine**: FFmpeg wrapper for video processing
- **Database**: SQLite for persistent local storage

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Streaming**: FFmpeg (multi-arch build)
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-arch support (x86_64 & ARM64)
- **Authentication**: Local username/password with bcrypt

## Test Cameras

The project includes configuration for local test cameras:

### Reolink (Fixed position camera)
- **Main Stream**: `rtsp://Wharfside:Wharfside2025!!@192.168.86.250:554/Preview_01_main`
- **Snapshot**: `http://Wharfside:Wharfside2025!!@192.168.86.250:80/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=onvifSnapPic&channel=0`

### Sunba (PTZ camera with ONVIF support)
- **Main Stream**: `rtsp://192.168.86.23:554/user=admin_password=sOKDKxsV_channel=0_stream=0&onvif=0.sdp?real_stream`
- **Snapshot**: `http://192.168.86.23/webcapture.jpg?command=snap&channel=0&user=admin&password=sOKDKxsV`

## Development Status
