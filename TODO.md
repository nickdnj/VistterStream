## 📖 **Quick Reference Guide**

### **Before You Start Any Task:**
1. ✅ Read the relevant section in [StreamingPipeline-TechnicalSpec.md](docs/StreamingPipeline-TechnicalSpec.md)
2. ✅ Check cross-references in PRD, SAD, and UXD for context
3. ✅ Review database schema if touching data models
4. ✅ Understand failure recovery patterns for reliability features

### **Key Implementation Principles:**
- **Reliability First** - Auto-recovery, fallbacks, degraded mode over failure
- **Sequential per track, Parallel across tracks** - Timeline execution model
- **Hardware-accelerated** - Pi 5 (`h264_v4l2m2m`) and Mac (`h264_videotoolbox`)
- **Simple MVP, Complex Later** - Text/image overlays now, animations later
- **Multi-destination isolation** - One stream fails, others continue

- Camera issues? → See spec §"Failure Recovery System"
- Timeline questions? → See spec §"Multi-Track Timeline System"
- FFmpeg problems? → See spec §"Streaming Pipeline Architecture" + §"Hardware Acceleration"
